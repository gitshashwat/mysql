[1]. How will you insert into a table called A with columns: entity_name,filter,mdm_filter,status,
priority,date_field,auto_extract,field_name,filter_description?
[Ans]:
INSERT INTO A(entity_name,filter,mdm_filter,status,
priority,date_field,auto_extract,field_name,filter_description)
VALUES ('summary','dob',1,1,28,1,0,'summary.dob','DOB');

[2]: Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
[Ans]:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE ID % 2 = 0;

[3]: Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

[Ans]:
(select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY),CITY LIMIT 1)
UNION ALL
(select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC,CITY LIMIT 1)

[4]: Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

[Ans]:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%'
or CITY LIKE 'i%' or CITY LIKE 'o%' or CITY LIKE 'u%'

[5]: Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

[Ans]: SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e'
or CITY LIKE '%i' or CITY LIKE '%o' or CITY LIKE '%u'

[6]: Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

[Ans]: SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY,1,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') AND SUBSTR(CITY,-1,1) in ('A','E','I','O','U');

[7]: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

[Ans]: SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

[8]: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

[Ans]: SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY,-1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

[9]: Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks . 
Order your output by the last three characters of each name.
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

[Ans]: select Name from STUDENTS where Marks>75 ORDER BY SUBSTR(Name,-3,3), ID asc;

[10]: How will you round off to two places in SQL?
[Ans]: ROUND(COL_NAME,2)
