1. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Ans:
select round(long_W,4) from station where
lat_n = (select max(lat_n) from station where
lat_n<137.2345) ;

2. Consider P1 and P2 to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N)
Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and format your answer to display 4  decimal digits.
Ans: select ROUND((
    SQRT(
        POWER((
            min(lat_n)-max(lat_n)
            ),2)
        +
        POWER((
            min(long_w)-max(long_w)
            ),2)
        )
        ),4) from station;
        
3. Calculate the average by removing zeros from salary: ex- 3402 becomes 342 or 22100 becomes 221.
Ans: select avg(replace(salary,"0",""))) from table

4. We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings
